# Fingerprint Recognition System with AI and Cybersecurity

A secure biometric recognition prototype integrating fingerprint liveness detection using CNNs, identity matching via OpenCV, and enhanced privacy through federated learning and differential privacy. Built for final year research and presentation.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:

- Detect spoofed vs. real fingerprint images using AI (ResNet18)
- Match real fingerprints for identity verification
- Secure biometric data with Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP)
- Provide modular, real-time fingerprint recognition pipeline

---

## Features

### Liveness Detection (AI)
- CNN-based detection using ResNet18
- Trained on fingerprint datasets (`live` vs `spoof` folders)
- Output: Probability of being a live fingerprint

### Fingerprint Matching
- ORB + BFMatcher via OpenCV
- Keypoint-based comparison of fingerprint images
- Match confidence threshold configurable

### Privacy & Security
- **Federated Learning** using Flower
- **Differential Privacy** using Opacus (PyTorch)
- Simulated multi-client training with epsilon control

### Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR)

## Getting Started

### 🧪 Local Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zafriiii/fingerprint-system.git
   cd fingerprint-system
   ```

2. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Train model (optional):
   ```bash
   python liveness_detection_model.py
   ```

5. Run CLI demo:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. Run GUI demo:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Demonstration Workflow

1. Upload fingerprint image using OpenCV or GUI
2. Run liveness detection (ResNet18)
3. If result is **Live**:
   - Match fingerprint with known template
   - Output result: `Match` or `Mismatch`
4. If **Spoofed**: Reject immediately
